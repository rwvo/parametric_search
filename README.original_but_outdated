Version:          1.0 (June 2003)

CGAL Versions:    2.3 and greater

Supported Compilers & Platforms:

Purpose:
     This package provides a framework for implementing applications
     of the parametric search technique.

Description:

      Distributed with this package are the following things:
        README       -- this file
        DOC/         -- directory containing the package documentation in
                        PostScript and PDF format
        cep_test     -- shell script for running the test suite
        include/     -- directory containing the parametric_search header files
	Tutorial/    -- directory containing the files described in
                        the tutorial part of the documentation; these
                        files are also used as test suit


Installation:
      1) Make a directory ${CGAL_HOME}/include/CEP/paramteric_search
      2) Copy all files from the include/ directory in this package to
         the directory created in the previous step.

Documentation:
      Package documentation is provided in Postscript and PDF format in
      the subdirectory doc.
     
Tested items:

Testing process:
      The example code for computing the Frechet distance between two
      polygonal curves is compiled and run. This code uses all classes
      from the parametric search framework, and all constructors and
      classes of the framework are actually called.
